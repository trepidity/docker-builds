An example Ping Identity PingDirectory container, running in Alpine Linux using OpenJDK8, loaded up with a few sample users.

## PingDirectory License
Before running the pingdirectory docker image, you must obtain a Ping Directory License.  Please visit:

Upon receiving your license file, please proceed with the ```docker run``` command, substituting the license filename with the file that you've saved the license to.

## Running a PingDirectory container

```
  docker run \
           --name pingdirectory \
           --publish 1389:389 \
           --publish 8443:443 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/server-profile-pingidentity-getting-started.git \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=pingdirectory \
           pingidentity/pingdirectory
```
After approximately 30 seconds, the new license will be added, and the service will be stated.  If no license is provided, or an invalid/expired license is provided, the docker container will exit.  You may view the docker logs with the command:

```
  docker logs -f pingdirectory
```

To stop the container

```
  docker container stop pingdirectory
```

## Run a sample 100/sec search rate test

```
docker exec -it pingdirectory \
        /opt/out/instance/bin/searchrate \
                -b dc=example,dc=com \
                --scope sub \
                --filter "(uid=user.[1-9])" \
                --attribute mail \
